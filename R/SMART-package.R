#' @title \emph{SMART}: A modular platform for creating reproducible applications
#' @description \emph{SMART} is a \code{shiny} app template for creating
#'   reproducible applications to academic standards. SMART is forked from 'wallace'
#'   and provides a template for producing applications that are interactive,
#'   reproducible, adaptable and built to high standards. It was created to ease
#'   the process of creating complex workflows in a single, streamlined GUI interface.
#'   In addition, executable session code  (R Markdown format) can
#'    be downloaded to share with others or use as supplementary information
#'    for scientific papers and reports. The application is run via the
#'    function \code{\link{run_smart}}.

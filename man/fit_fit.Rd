\title{Fit a disaggregation model}
\usage{
fit_fit(data, priors, family, link, iterations, field, iid, async = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{disag_data.  Object returned by prepare_data function that
contains all the necessary objects for the model fitting}

\item{priors}{list. List of prior values}

\item{family}{character. Model family to fit}

\item{link}{character. Link function to use}

\item{iterations}{numeric. Number of iterations}

\item{field}{logical. Whether to include a spatial field}

\item{iid}{logical. Whether to include an iid effect}

\item{async}{logical. Whether or not the function is being used asynchronously}
}
\value{
a list of class \code{disag_model} or a character string if an error occurs
}
\description{
This function is called by the fit_fit module and calls
disaggregation::disag_model() with the only difference being that covariates
are wrapped to enable asynchronous operation and any errors are returned as
a character

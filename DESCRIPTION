Package: disagapp
Version: 0.0.1
Title: A 'shiny' Application for Disaggregation Regression 
Description: Perform user-friendly disaggregation regression analyses using  
    'disaggregation'. Use when analysing response data that are aggregated to 
    polygon level but the predictor variables are at a higher resolution. 
    Multiple options are provided for loading response data, downloading 
    covariate data and fitting models. Analyses can be saved 
    and loaded and an 'rmarkdown' document can be downloaded to reproduce the 
    analysis. To enable all functionality install with 
    install.packages("disagapp", dependencies = TRUE) .
    Run locally with run_disagapp() 
    or use a version deployed to <https://disagapp.le.ac.uk> . 
    Disagapp was built using 'shinyscholar'.

### **Module:** ***Make predictions***

**BACKGROUND**

This module generates predictions from the fitted model for the area of interest. You can choose to convert the rate predictions to cases and to generate uncertainty predictions by toggling the switches. 
Once you have generated the predictions you can download a `.zip` file of them.

**IMPLEMENTATION** 

- This module uses `disaggregation::predict_model()` to generate the rate predictions and `disaggregation::predict_uncertainty()` to generate the uncertainty predictions. 
The cases are generated by multiplying the rate prediction by the aggregation raster. 

- If you have included an IID effect in the model then you can choose whether or not to include this term when generating the predictions. 

- If you choose to generate uncertainty predictions you can select the credible interval of the uncertainty and the number of iterations used to generate the uncertainty predictions. 

- Once you have made your selection about which predictions to generate, click *Produce model predictions* and the output will be visible on the map.

### **Module: Transfer predictions**

**BACKGROUND**

This module uses the fitted model to transfer predictions to a new area for which you do not have response data. 

**IMPLEMENTATION**

Select a country from the dropdown list and click "Transfer Predictions". This module has to load all of the data for the new country and so may take a very long time to complete.

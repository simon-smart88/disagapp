### **Module:** ***Uniform aggregation***

**BACKGROUND**

If the response data cannot be linked to some measure of population inside the polygons, then this module can be used to generate a uniform aggregation raster. For example if the response data was average air pollution 
within the polygon, there may be no way of knowing where in the polygon the pollution was generated.

**IMPLEMENTATION**

Click *Create uniform raster* to generate the raster.

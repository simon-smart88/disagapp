### **Module:** ***Climate***

**BACKGROUND**

Climate affects disease, for example cholera is affected by rainfall and flooding, the transmission of airborne disease is influenced by temperature and humidity, and for vector-borne diseases temperature and rainfall affect the lifecycles of vectors (Mahmud *et al.* 2020). Climatic variables are therefore important covariates in many analyses and the WorldClim bioclimatic variables are a global dataset of 19 variables relating to temperature and precipitation.

**IMPLEMENTATION**

- Data are provided from the WorldClim 2.1 dataset, specifically the bioclimatic variables at a 30 arc-second resolution (approximately 1km at the equator). Quarters are defined as any three month long sequence. 
Data are downloaded via the `geodata::worldclim_country` function, but unfortunately the files contain all of the variables so depending on the area of interest can be very large and slow to download.

- The following variables are available for temperature: 

    - Mean temperature
    - Mean diurnal range - the mean difference between monthly minimum and maximum temperatures
    - Isothermality - how large day to night temperature variations are relative to annual variations
    - Temperature seasonality - the standard deviation of monthly mean temperature
    - Maximum temperature warmest month 
    - Minimum temperature coldest month
    - Temperature range - the difference between the maximum temperature of the warmest month and minimum temperature of the coldest month
    - Mean temperature wettest quarter
    - Mean temperature driest quarter
    - Mean temperature warmest quarter
    - Mean temperature coldest quarter
                            
- The following variables are available for precipitation:

    - Total precipitation
    - Precipitation wettest month
    - Precipitation driest month
    - Precipitation seasonality - the coefficient of variation (standard deviation / mean) of monthly precipitation
    - Precipitation wettest quarter
    - Precipitation driest quarter
    - Precipitation warmest quarter
    - Precipitation coldest quarter

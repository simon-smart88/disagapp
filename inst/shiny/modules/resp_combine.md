### **Module: Combine spreadsheet and shapefile**

* This module is for use when you response data is in a spreadsheet (.csv or .xlsx) and boundary data in a shapefile. The spreadsheet needs to contain a column identifying the areas which is also present in the shapefile (although the names can differ).

* Click on "Browse..." and select the spreadsheet file.

* After selecting the spreadsheet file, the "Select spreadsheet response column" and "Select spreadsheet area column" boxes will appear. Click on the boxes to choose the columns that contain the response data and the names of the areas.

* Click on "Browse..." and select all four files associated with the shapefile, ending in .dbf, .prj, .shp and .shx. 

* After selecting the shapefile, the "Select shapefile area column" box will appear. Click on the box to choose the columns that contain the names of the areas.

* Finally, click "Load data" and the data will be plotted on the map. If any rows in the spreadsheet cannot be matched with the boundary data, errors will be printed in the log window.

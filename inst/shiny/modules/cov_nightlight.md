### **Module:** ***Nighttime lights***

**BACKGROUND**

Satellite imagery of the Earth captured at night can detect sources of artificial lighting. The intensity of nighttime lights provides information on economic activity and in turn poverty. 

**IMPLEMENTATION**

- This module loads data via the Worldpop Hub (Woods *et al*. (2025).

- The data returned is the average annual nighttime illumination that is processed to remove anomalies as described by Elvidge *et al*. (2021). It is downloaded at 100 m resolution and resampled to 1 km.

- To obtain the data, select the country or countries that cover your area of interest, select the year of interest and click *Load data*.

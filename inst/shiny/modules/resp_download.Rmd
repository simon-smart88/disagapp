```{asis, echo = {{resp_download_knit}}, eval = {{resp_download_knit}}, include = {{resp_download_knit}}}
Download boundary data and combine with the uploaded response data. You need to specify the directory unless the spreadsheet is in your current working directory.
```

```{r, echo = {{resp_download_knit}}, include = {{resp_download_knit}}}
response_directory <- ""

#read in the response data
response_file <- "{{data_path}}"
response_file_path <- file.path(response_directory, response_file)
file_format <- tools::file_ext(response_file_path)
if (file_format == "csv"){
  response_df <- read.csv(response_file_path)
} else if (file_format == "xlsx"){
  response_df <- openxlsx::read.xlsx(response_file_path)
}

#download the boundary data and merge with the response data
shape <- disagapp::resp_download(df = response_df,
                     area_column = "{{area_column}}",
                     resp_column = "{{resp_column}}",

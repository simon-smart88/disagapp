### **Module: Land use**

**BACKGROUND**


**IMPLEMENTATION**

A separate layer is downloaded for each selected land use with the values of pixels corresponding to the percentage of land in that area corresponding to the land use category.

Data are downloaded as 20 degree tiles at 100 m resolution and converted to 1 km resolution. Depending on your area of interest and the number of land uses chosen, this module may take a considerable time to return the data.

To download the data, choose from the list of land use categories, select the year and click "Download data".

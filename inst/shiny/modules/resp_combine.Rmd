```{asis, echo = {{resp_combine_knit}}, eval = {{resp_combine_knit}}, include = {{resp_combine_knit}}}
Upload response data from a spreadsheet and polygon data from a shapefile and merge to create an sf object. You need to specify the directories of the files unless they are in your current working directory.
```

```{r, echo = {{resp_combine_knit}}, include = {{resp_combine_knit}}}

response_directory <- ""
shapefile_directory <- ""

#read in the response data
response_file <- "{{resp_combine_spread_path}}"
response_file_path <- file.path(response_directory, response_file)
file_format <- tools::file_ext(response_file_path)
if (file_format == "csv"){
  response_df <- read.csv(response_file_path)
} else if (file_format == "xlsx"){
  response_df <- openxlsx::read.xlsx(response_file_path)
}

#read in the shapefile data
shapefile_files <- {{resp_combine_shape_path}}
shapefile_file_paths <- file.path(shapefile_directory, shapefile_files)
shapefile_file_df <- data.frame(datapath = shapefile_file_paths, name = shapefile_files)

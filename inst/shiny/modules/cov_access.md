### **Module: Accessibility**

**BACKGROUND**

Accessibility affects the ability of people to access resources and services that are only available in urban locations. It is influenced by distance, transport infrastructure and the spatial distribution of cities. 

**IMPLEMENTATION**
Three layers are available: 

- Travel time to cities (2015)
- Motorized travel time to healthcare (2020)
- Walking only travel time to healthcare (2020)

Data are obtained via the `malariaAtlas::getRaster()` function. 

To download the data, select the layer you want to use from the dropdown list and then click ""Download data".

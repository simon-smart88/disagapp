```{asis, echo = {{resp_shape_knit}}, eval = {{resp_shape_knit}}, include = {{resp_shape_knit}}}
Upload the shapefile and create an sf object. You need to specify the directory of the shape files unless they are in your current working directory.
```

```{r, echo = {{resp_shape_knit}}, include = {{resp_shape_knit}}}
shapefile_directory <- ""
shapefile_files <- {{resp_shape_path}}
shapefile_file_paths <- file.path(shapefile_directory, shapefile_files)
shapefile_file_df <- data.frame(datapath = shapefile_file_paths, name = shapefile_files)
shape <- disagapp::resp_shape(shapefile_file_df)
```

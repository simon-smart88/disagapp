### **Component: Aggregation data**

**ORIENTATION**

This component loads the aggregation data. This is typically population count data. You must use at least one module before proceeding to the next component. 

#### <span class="module_choice">Worldpop</span>
Population count data provided by Worldpop.

#### <span class="module_choice">Upload aggregation</span>
Upload your own aggregation raster.

#### <span class="module_choice">Uniform</span>
There may be cases where you do not wish to use an aggregation variable in which case you can use this module to generate a uniform raster to use instead.

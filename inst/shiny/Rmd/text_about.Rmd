### **What is *disagapp*?**  

<img src="logo.png" alt="logo" style="width: 150px; float:right; padding:10px;"/>

Welcome to *disagapp* an application that can be used to perform disaggregation regression analyses using [{disaggregation}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=disaggregation). 

The application is written in `R` with the web app development package `shiny` and was built using the [{shinyscholar}](https://github.com/simon-smart88/shinyscholar) template which was itself forked from {wallace} v2.0.5 ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=wallace), [website](https://wallaceecomod.github.io/wallace/index.html)), an application for modelling species distributions (Kass et. al 2018; Kass et al. 2022).

### **Attributes of _disagapp_**

* **accessible**: lowers barriers to conducting disaggregation regression analysis

* **open**: the code is free to use and modify (GPL 3.0)

* **expandable**: users can author and contribute modules that enable new methodological options

* **flexible**: options for user uploads and downloads of results

* **interactive**: includes an embedded zoomable `leaflet` map, sortable `DF` data tables, and visualizations of results

* **instructive**: features guidance text that educates users about theoretical and analytical aspects of each step in the workflow

* **reproducible**: users can download an `rmarkdown` .Rmd file that when run reproduces the analysis, ability to save sessions and load later

* **robust**: modules and their underlying functions are tested using `testthat` and `shinytest2`

### **Component: Covariate Data**

**ORIENTATION**

This component loads the covariate data - that is the data that you wish to use to predict the response data from. Covariate data is in the form of *rasters* containing pixels of various sizes. You must use at least one module before proceeding to the next component.

If you are running the app locally, some modules require authentication. 

Depending on the area of your response data, some of the covariates may take a considerable time to download.

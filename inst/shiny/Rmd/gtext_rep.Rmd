### **Component: Reproduce**

**ORIENTATION**

Scientific practice increasingly emphasizes documentation and reproducibility and *shinyscholar* is designed to facilitate this. *shinyscholar* promotes documentation and downstream assessment of modeling quality by allowing users to download extensive information that includes sources of input data, methodological decisions, and results. One option for the documentation (see Module: *Download Session Code*) is a file that can be re-run in R to reproduce the analyses (if re-run on exactly the same versions of R and dependent packages). Many intermediate and advanced users of R likely will find this file useful as a template for modification. Additionally, *shinyscholar* provides citations of the particular R packages (and their versions) used in a given analysis (Module: *Reference Packages*).
